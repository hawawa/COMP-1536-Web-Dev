			<h3>Fortune in 2017 & 2018</h3>
			
			<p class="fortune" id="dog_fortune">
			People born in the Year of Dog have a good fortune in 2017. As long as they work hard, they are likely to make progress and get promoted in the work. Their fortune in wealth is not very satisfying, so it is better avoid high-risk investments. Their health might be affected by some ailments. 2018 is the Zodiac Year of Birth (Ben Ming Nian) for Dog people. The overall fortune is not good enough. High pressure from work and financial aspects would make them feel exhausted. More divergences will arise between Dog people and their family members.
