			<p class="fortune" id="goat_fortune">
			The fortune for people with Chinese zodiac Sheep sign is just so-so in 2017, with many ups and downs falling upon in every aspect. The situation seems not to improve in 2018, when their overall luck can be upset. There will be obstacles in career and wealth. Expenditures will climb up; meanwhile, a casual investment may cause money loss. To support the daily life, it is suggested to make a detailed plan for all costs. Fierce competition in career may block their way of promotion, but they can still make a difference with hard working. The Year of the Dog sees tiny possibility for Sheep people to find their soul mates, but there are still exceptions. Singles can still have a try to seek after their love. As for health, they will feel well in most cases, but there may be something wrong with their respiratory system and stomach.
